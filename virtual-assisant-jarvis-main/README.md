Virtual Assistant "Jarvis" ‚Äî Personal Project
Jan 2025 ‚Äì Present
Technologies Used: Python, OpenAI GPT, Whisper, OpenCV, LangChain, SpeechRecognition, Text-to-Speech, Raspberry Pi (optional), FastAPI

Project Description:

Developed a voice-activated virtual assistant inspired by Jarvis (Marvel), capable of understanding and responding to natural language commands.

Integrated OpenAI GPT for conversational intelligence and dynamic task handling.

Used Whisper for speech-to-text conversion and gTTS / pyttsx3 for speech synthesis (TTS).

Implemented computer vision using OpenCV for facial recognition and object tracking.

Built modular tools for:

Web search & summarization

Smart home control (IoT integration)

Daily briefings (weather, calendar, news)

Deployed via FastAPI backend with a local or cloud-based interface.

Key Achievements:

Created a natural and context-aware conversation flow using LangChain agents and tools.

Designed a plugin-like tool system for scalability (e.g., calculator, web scraper, reminder system).

Built CLI and voice interfaces for desktop and mobile access.

üìù If You Want a Shorter Version:
